# ConQ_Unity_5_Editor

A range of useful editor scripts for Unity 5

## Create Materials From Images:
Useful when you don't want to create every material from hand. This gives you a good starting point, simply by selecting all the Albedo maps and hitting that button. It will create materials based on that map and it's name. [CreateMaterialsFromImages](https://github.com/ConQode/ConQ_Unity_5_Editor/blob/main/Assets/Editor/CreateMaterialsFromImages.cs)

## Generate Resolver File:
Helps to easily generate a HoneySelect resolver file with a few inputs for the HSResolverMoreSlotID. [GenerateResolverFile](https://github.com/ConQode/ConQ_Unity_5_Editor/blob/main/Assets/Editor/GenerateResolverFile.cs)

## Create Prefabs From Selection:
Useful to create multiple prefabs from your scene at once. Select the prefabs you want to create in your scene, then select a folder in the project window and hit the menu point and it will create your prefabs into that selected folder. [CreatePrefabsFromSelection](https://github.com/ConQode/ConQ_Unity_5_Editor/blob/main/Assets/Editor/CreatePrefabFromSelection.cs)

## Texture Combiner:
It combines a Metal and a Roughness map, by adding the Roughness map into the alpha channel of the Metal map, allowing to have a form of roughness aswell in the Unity Standard Shaders of Unity 5.

## Material Duplicator:
This allows to easily make a duplicate of the selected material and save it under a custom name. [MaterialDuplicator](https://github.com/ConQode/ConQ_Unity_5_Editor/blob/main/Assets/Editor/MaterialDuplicator.cs)
